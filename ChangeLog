	* dorrie/ : Moved the Django project to dorrie folder

2009-12-10 Shreyank Gupta <sgupta@redhat.com>

    * comps/parse.py (build_ks): Repo, Include and Part hacks.

2009-12-5 Dimitris Glezos <mits@cat.ix>

Settings and docs:

- Fix ReST syntax
- SQLite is now the default instead of mysql
- Auto-define APP_DIR to avoid asking the user to do it.

Imports:

- Import things by priority (python bits, external deps, django core,
  django-contrib, other dorrie apps, current app) and then alphabetically.
- Keep namespaces in imports (avoid importing too many things from the same
	module -- just import the module and reference them with a prefix.)

Various:

- Used help_text in model fields
- Concatenage
- Import django's settings from djago.conf.settings and keep namespace.
